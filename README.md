# Seed Phrase Generator (WalletGen) GPU Accelerated 
# Work in Progress

WalletGen is a high-speed, GPU-accelerated crypto wallet generator and balance checker created for recovering lost or inactive Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB, Polygon (MATIC), and other EVM-compatible wallets. Built in C++ for performance, it supports brute-force seed phrase generation, balance checking using local databases or real-time explorer queries, and seed recovery with missing words.

This version is enhanced by Alex with CUDA-based GPU acceleration for massively improved performance during wallet generation and scanning.
